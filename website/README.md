## Website - Eventually Will Do

- [ ] [Generate Sitemap Dynamically](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generate-sitemap)
  - [ ] Likely just adding the steps to doing such in the `/delete-me`
- [ ] Create Skeleton Components (easier to remove/modify than to create)
  - [ ] Navbar
  - [ ] Footer
  - [ ] Contact Form
- [ ] Add robots.txt
- [ ] Add steps to modify theme to `/delete-me`.
  - [ ] Where is tailwind `theme`?
  - [ ] Create structure for common style-guide in app.css (h1-h6, button, a, etc.)
- [ ] Change all to-dos in `/delete-me` to come from Hygraph so I have an example
- [ ] Add prompt to remove hygraph package if they didn't opt into CMS.
- [ ] Add Data Analytics to it so I have it ready
- [ ] Add how to remove data analytics from it in `/delete-me` in case they opt out of it
- [ ] Make it an actual website, so I can go `/:project/delete-me` to view the status of everything I need to do to get that project started.
