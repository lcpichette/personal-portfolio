## About the Project

### Color Palette

While I have a certificate as a UX Designer, and a certificate as a UI Designer, I decided to go 
for an established and well-loved color palette. For this, my go-to resource is coolors.co. 
Here's the link to the community-made color palette that this website uses: [...4749](https://coolors.co/palette/386641-6a994e-a7c957-f2e8cf-bc4749)

- #386641
- #6A994E
- #A7C957
- #F2E8CF
- #BC4749

I decided to go for this color palette because it is strong and fresh (earthy tones), but shows 
splashes of bold and powerful (red). I feel that I can be described in a similar way.

## Using

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
